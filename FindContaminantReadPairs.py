## Overview: this script reads in one blast file of hits for forward reads and
## one for backward reads (from paired-read data). It finds read pairs for which
## either a) both reads blast to something other than the named sequence, or b)
## one read blasts to the named sequence and its mate blasts to something else
## but that second blast has a better evalue. The names of the reads in these
## pairs are written, without preserving their original order, to two files: one
## for forward reads and one for reverse reads.
## The intended use is for processing the result of blasting paired-read data
## to a database consisting of something that looks like your sample plus other
## sequences that should be recognised as contamination. (For example, if de
## novo assembly has been done with these reads, some of the resulting contigs
## may be identified as contamination -- we want to find the reads that
## correspond to those contigs, in order to remove them.)

# Antiquated code, from when non-contaminant read pairs were printed:
'''
## NB we discard pairs where one read blasted to the reference and the other
## did not blast to anything. Our reasons are two-fold. 1) Keeping such 'pairs'
## would involve making the assumption that the read missing from the blast 
## table really exists; it might not. 2) Though we do keep reads where
## one read hits the reference and the other hits a contaminant (if the
## contaminant hit is not as good as the reference hit), it's not inconsistent
## to discard pairs where one hits the reference and the other doesn't blast at
## all. In the former case, the contaminant hit could be masking a hit to the
## reference that's almost as good; in the latter case, one can be sure that the
## missing read (if it exists) failed to blast to the reference at all.
