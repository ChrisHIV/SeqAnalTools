## Overview: takes a fastq file sorted by read name, e.g. with
## $ cat MyReads.fq | paste - - - - | sort -k1,1 -t " " | tr "\t" "\n" > out.fq
## and a file of read names sorted in the same way (one read name per line), and
## finds those reads, printing them to the screen suitable for redirection into
## another fastq file.
## Usage:
## $ FindNamedReadsInSortedFastq.py AllReadsSorted.fastq ReadNamesIwant.txt
